@scotts3409,"The record-break forest fires in Canada are caused by a lack of precipitation. Those warm and dry conditions in the Northern Hemisphere are precipitated by changes in global weather patterns as a result of the greenhouse effect on planet Earth. 

Unfortunately for Earth, it's a cascade effect as forests sequester greenhouse gases. When the forests burn, those gases are released back into the atmosphere as they're no longer trapped in trees. It's why we refer to it as the runaway greenhouse effect. Indeed, it these very Forest Fires release of carbon dioxide that will cause more fires to occur.

You're correct in saying fire would heat up the house. The difference is it is not the heat of the fires warming the planet, but their release of carbon dioxide which clouds our atmosphere and does not let heat escape into outer space.",2023-07-31T01:22:22Z,0,,the record break forest fires in canada are caused by a lack of precipitation those warm and dry conditions in the northern hemisphere are precipitated by changes in global weather patterns as a result of the greenhouse effect on planet earth unfortunately for earth it s a cascade effect as forests sequester greenhouse gases when the forests burn those gases are released back into the atmosphere as they re no longer trapped in trees it s why we refer to it as the runaway greenhouse effect indeed it these very forest fires release of carbon dioxide that will cause more fires to occur you re correct in saying fire would heat up the house the difference is it is not the heat of the fires warming the planet but their release of carbon dioxide which clouds our atmosphere and does not let heat escape into outer space

@indoorandoutdoorendurance3889,"My comment is that we're always worried about losing some of the Amazon rain forest, and we want to plant trees to help with global warming, climate change, and so on. However, at the same time we cannot even stop these forest fires from burning off large amounts of forest. This all seems like a big waste of forestation, but of course it's entirely natural. In fact, the longer we go without having enough fires, the more prone we are to having gigantic fires all at once. Regardless, I wonder what all this burning is doing for our environment and the global warming/climate change situation. As I hinted, I think if we were to try to prevent these fires, we would be in danger of having gigantic ones later that would be all the more out of control. This is nature's ""safety valve,"" to use an expression.",2023-07-24T14:02:07Z,0,0.0,my comment is that we re always worried about losing some of the amazon rain forest and we want to plant trees to help with global warming climate change and so on however at the same time we cannot even stop these forest fires from burning off large amounts of forest this all seems like a big waste of forestation but of course it s entirely natural in fact the longer we go without having enough fires the more prone we are to having gigantic fires all at once regardless i wonder what all this burning is doing for our environment and the global warming climate change situation as i hinted i think if we were to try to prevent these fires we would be in danger of having gigantic ones later that would be all the more out of control this is nature s safety valve to use an expression

@chalmerscharitycrouse7834,"Comment 4,156: They need to lay off the burn pits that are covering up for their crimes.

Why didn't they make fire breaks? They used to do it in California. Then the state said they could not afford it (what about their ""former offender"" as fireman program, though? Does someone want to talk about their ""union negotiation"" this upcoming week...?) and so private individuals carried it on, but there was not enough...In all this time, after what's been happening for years, they could not figure this out? their surveying budget did not already factor in where and in what manner to engage this? Oh I know, now it's an emergency...right?

No one needs a ""bikini"" today.

The Atlantic Ocean and those lakes can be cold...very cold...

If it is still burning, where do they think it's going to go?

Is it an actual ""wildfire"" or did someone leave the Atlantic seaboard vulnerable intentionally while they diverted through the Pacific Coast?

I mean, I am certain there are going to be ""medical claims"" regarding the ""smoke inhalation"" now, right?

@DrMomans,"""Officials can't stop it""

I never imagined you could stop a fire sitting behind a desk or giving fancy speeches

And why would you wait until the fire starts to stop it? From the aerial footage, the forest looks denser than Bigfoot's armpits. The key is preventing wild fires by methodical responsible logging. Every other 10 acres, you divide into lots and log every other acre inside it. While at it, you create emergency routes in the forest for easy fire fighter access in case of future fires. Then you re-plant new trees in the areas that were logged and leave it alone for a minimum of 10 years.

Young trees harvest more carbon than old ones, so basically win-win on all aspects. But God forbid we have too much lumber on the market and get affordable housing as a side effect. Home builders and their zoning ""officials"" friends won't like that",2023-07-22T19:24:14Z,0,0.0,officials can t stop it i never imagined you could stop a fire sitting behind a desk or giving fancy speeches and why would you wait until the fire starts to stop it from the aerial footage the forest looks denser than bigfoot s armpits the key is preventing wild fires by methodical responsible logging every other 10 acres you divide into lots and log every other acre inside it while at it you create emergency routes in the forest for easy fire fighter access in case of future fires then you re plant new trees in the areas that were logged and leave it alone for a minimum of 10 years young trees harvest more carbon than old ones so basically win win on all aspects but god forbid we have too much lumber on the market and get affordable housing as a side effect home builders and their zoning officials friends won t like that

(My Dad accomplished this design and functionality of water to the property from the aquifer all on his own,.. IF he can do that then certainly the forest service can do that.)

As the weather is approaching they can keep that land damp enough to prevent forest fires from happening in the first place.

@teddyp1605,"Stop oil? Removing animal cruelty from your plate is the single most impactful way to stop environmental devastation and global warming. Animal Agriculture is the leading driver of human induced cruelty, pandemics, climate change, poor health, deforestation, water depletion, habitat loss, species extinction and world hunger. We're literally eating ourselves to extinction. Over 80 billion land animals are killed every year and suffer incomprehensible cruelty before a horrific death to needlessly feed selfish, arrogant carnivores with no moral integrity. The vast majority of these land animals are fed field crops. These field crops include all varieties of wheat, barley, corn, oats, rye, canola, flaxseed, soybeans, dry peas, lentils, dry beans, chickpeas, mustard seed, canary seed, and sunflower seed. Just 55 percent of the world's crop calories are actually eaten directly by people. Another 36 percent is used for animal feed. 77% of the world's soy is fed to livestock for meat and dairy production, while less than 10% of soy bean crops are used for human consumption. One of the biggest drivers of deforestation is agriculture. Farmland expansion is responsible for 90 percent of deforestation around the world, including crops grown for both human and animal consumption, as well as the clearing of forests for animal grazing. On its own, animal grazing accounts for 40 percent of deforestation. According to the 2021 report ""Greenhouse gas emissions from animal-based foods are twice those of plant-based foods"" published in Nature Food, the livestock sector is responsible for 20% of all human-caused GHG emissions and 60% of food system GHG emissions (twice that of plant-based foods). Livestock account for 37% of human-related methane production. Methane is important because it is a much stronger greenhouse gas. In technical terms, it has a higher global warming potential (GWP). Take all animal products off your plate as they are not only unnecessary, but unhealthy as well. Let's be the generation who gives a damn. Stop abusing animals for your taste buds! Go Vegan! Buy Vegan!

@chrisandlizsizemore8172,"@@imcorrect9122 Best do some research on ice ages, then, if that's your gotcha argument. Simply put: Ice ages cover two types of periods that last thousands of years. Glacial (it's cold) and Interglacial (what we've been in for the past 10,000 years). Guess which one were in? (hint: it's not Glacial)

If what you think is true, is actually true, then logically interglacial periods should be consistently the same temperature of normal Earth for 10,000 years.  As in hardly any change. Variance, sure. But the 10,000 year average should be pretty darn close to what it is today. But it's not? 

Also - you know that Ice Ages are created by Earth's deviance from the Sun in space, right? Something that is actually measurable today. Wouldn't it stand to reason that astronomers, whose only job is to study space, would have noticed Earth's gradual shift? 

Also also - if an Ice Age was a'comin', my knees would be a'feelin' da cold! We're not going into a Glacial period (which, again, is a drop in temperature).  We're still in the Interglacial (which, again, is thousands of years of average Earth temps as we know it).

@zackmorgan4500,"@@Jake-xr4ii it would be less than one degree and the majority of scientists which I have a degree in say it would be so minimal it wouldn't be measurable, but to make it easier for the average person to understand it's less than one degree which is absolutely nothing. 

When you hear the climate alarmist in the media mafia and leftist politicians exclaim ""most scientists agree"" they are being extremely misleading. The scientists they have manipulated to go along with their narrative agree. When the real scientists tell the truth they are personally attack and the climate nuts try to have them cancelled. I guess you are aware none of the ""most scientists agree crowd"" will not debate with a real scientist that uses real facts and truth because they have neither. There are currently million dollar offers made to Bill Nye the science guy, Al Gore and plenty of other outspoken climate alarmist to debate REAL scientists on the subject of human caused global warming and they all refuse. They know that history, facts and numbers go against everything they say and they have no proof of any of the wild claims they make. 

Are you aware that none of their predictions ever come true and they have been caught dozens of times doctoring numbers and manipulating results in a effort to make it appear that what they are saying is true because their figures are never even close.

What ""most REAL scientists agree with"" is that a warmer planet would be better for humans and wildlife. Food could be grown where it can't currently to feed a growing population and animals could inhabit areas they couldn't before. I could list many more advantages of a warmer planet and very few negatives. The ice isn't going to melt and flood the world despite their ridiculous claims that are based in fantasy not reality.

Do you think insurance companies would insure structures anywhere near the coast if they really believed the ocean was going to rise and destroy them. Do you think big financial institutions that push these climate initiatives would loan trillion of dollars all over the world to build resorts, houses and businesses along the coast if they believed sea levels would rise destroying their collateral on these loans? You would be extremely naive to believe that. They talk the talk but don't walk the walk.

This human caused climate hysteria has been pushed on the gullible and misinformed who believe this nonsense that is pushed by the leftist media, politicians and the rich who are making millions and expanding their power with this hoax. They use sad commercials showing polar bears claiming they are in terrible condition, starving and going extinct. They just released a study that polar bears are healthy, happy and their numbers are higher than any point in recorded history, but despite this the commercials still run. You can see plenty of examples in the comment section of people exactly like this who have bought into the lie hook, line and sinker.

Another lie they like to tell and constantly push is that catastrophic weather events are more common and more deadly today than any point in history. This is a total fabrication and can easily be dispelled by anyone who is interested in the truth. Just in the time we have been keeping written records of such events shows that even before industrialization these events were both more frequent and produced more casualties. We don't even have to go back to archeological evidence that is further proof of the lie. The facts are out there for those that have been brainwashed into believing this silliness and they should do themselves a favor and learn the facts instead of being lazy and believing what the talking heads tell them.

 Just look at all the lies and misinformation the leftist media, politicians, ""scientists"" and the rich and powerful told us about the scamdemic.

@marklogsdon7437,"I've watched several of the video captures from weather satellites of the wildfires starting.  There are claims of lightning and also some human causes. One particular video shows several fires and smoke clouds all happening within minutes of each other, separated by hundreds of miles.  These are the ones that I seriously question. I can understand that trees can smolder for hours if not days after a lightning hit. Sometimes hit trees blow up on impact because the water in them turns to steam immediately. But for the fires to blaze up almost at once from several places hundreds of miles apart, and claim it was the wind that stirred up the flames?  I think almost the entire thing was planned. I've learned enough from watching news programs over the last several years, that what ever reason the news media is putting out, it's not the actual reason.

@alikhat1647,"Burn off isn’t a conspiracy.  TWRA TN Wildlife Resource Agency) comes out and helps us burn off our woods in the spring.  Before I had my own land, my grandparents, dad and aunts and uncles would burn off the woods on their land with no support from anyone but each other and their farm hands.  Before that my great grandparents burned off the land in tradition passed to my great grandfather from his Chicamaugan parents and tribe.  When the first settlers came to the US they wrote about manicured forests.  How do you think the Native Americans were able to achieve such magnificent woodlands?  The average person today has regressed in how they take care of their forests.  I have areas of my property dedicated to wildlife habitat, and in those areas I have allowed vines and brush to grow around certain spots, but even that is carefully controlled.  All of this not only helps the trees to grow bigger by taking out saplings and vines that take resources.  The saplings will die regardless because they can’t compete and the vines will make the forest floor impassable while providing nothing beneficial and eventually taking over and depriving the trees.  Another thing that burnoff achieves is to kill the ticks and mosquitoes (not all of them, as animals bring them back the ticks in and the mosquitoes fly back in and re-lay their eggs after the first real hard rain, but it definitely helps).  All-in-all, burning off woods is positive for the growth of the plants, the wildlife that make the woods their habitat and the enjoyment of the environment.  It definitely requires a degree of responsibility (some heavy machinery helps) and proper timing, but when done correctly only the dead trees and debris on the ground burns.  I can’t imagine trying to do a controlled burn on thousands of acres in one of the driest climates in the US.  There’s a reason it’s only done once a year, and if a person misses their window they should just wait until the next year.  I have great respect for the Native Americans who did controlled burns, as they had none of the tools that we have today.  They at most could use controlled flow of creeks, streams and rivers through irrigation as a means of setting boundaries.",2023-07-21T00:15:11Z,8,,burn off isn t a conspiracy twra tn wildlife resource agency comes out and helps us burn off our woods in the spring before i had my own land my grandparents dad and aunts and uncles would burn off the woods on their land with no support from anyone but each other and their farm hands before that my great grandparents burned off the land in tradition passed to my great grandfather from his chicamaugan parents and tribe when the first settlers came to the us they wrote about manicured forests how do you think the native americans were able to achieve such magnificent woodlands the average person today has regressed in how they take care of their forests i have areas of my property dedicated to wildlife habitat and in those areas i have allowed vines and brush to grow around certain spots but even that is carefully controlled all of this not only helps the trees to grow bigger by taking out saplings and vines that take resources the saplings will die regardless because they can t compete and the vines will make the forest floor impassable while providing nothing beneficial and eventually taking over and depriving the trees another thing that burnoff achieves is to kill the ticks and mosquitoes not all of them as animals bring them back the ticks in and the mosquitoes fly back in and re lay their eggs after the first real hard rain but it definitely helps all in all burning off woods is positive for the growth of the plants the wildlife that make the woods their habitat and the enjoyment of the environment it definitely requires a degree of responsibility some heavy machinery helps and proper timing but when done correctly only the dead trees and debris on the ground burns i can t imagine trying to do a controlled burn on thousands of acres in one of the driest climates in the us there s a reason it s only done once a year and if a person misses their window they should just wait until the next year i have great respect for the native americans who did controlled burns as they had none of the tools that we have today they at most could use controlled flow of creeks streams and rivers through irrigation as a means of setting boundaries

@tekannon7803,"This is going to sound whacko, but here goes. Are we looking at the answer to climate change every day in the evening sky? Is the answer to climate change right over our heads? Is the moon where we should be looking to help regulate the temperatures when they get too high on earth? We have a tidal moon that is like a clock and rotates every 27 days. It gives us our 24 days. It is 400 times smaller than the sun and 400 times closer to the sun than the earth and being concentric, gives us a perfect eclipse. But it can also be made to become the opposite of solar panels; we could make the moon able to project panels that allow sunlight through, but less intensely. It's the perfect structure because it’s our moon, a tidal moon and since it rotates so slowly, putting sun-reduction panels around it, might not be as difficult as it seems. Does this sound workable? I say we should put the mars missions on hold and get that brilliant Elon Musk, and Bezos and have the world's billionaires’ all chip in and the rest of us try every idea we can come up with until we find the one that allows us to begin controlling the climate on the earth. The wakeup call is this summer's relentless heat waves and our forests burning like kindling of bonfire earth. We have still got a few decades to make trials and get a working model put in place.

@akasgsvirgil9503,"I grew up in this part of the world.  There isn't a Salmon run between the Upper Hudson/Indian River and Northern Ontario/Quebec that I'm not familiar with.  What you are seeing here makes zero sense.  

Right now, the Salmon are running. Its game time for everything on two and four legs who loves the taste of Salmon.  See those trees and in particular, the green growth under those trees?  Forest fires require brush such as that to be dry in order for the fire to sustain itself.  Furthermore, the forest floor in most of the region is wet moss/leaves and composted material.  Its very hard to burn.  In fact, during the 80's and early 90's when the Canadian Government and New York State would engage in controlled burns of part of the forest killed off by acid rain created by Mt. St. Helen's, the firefighters who set the fires would be there more to ensure the fires didn't go out rather than prevent the fires from getting out of control.  That's what they're not telling you.  Trust me.  Ive talked to literally hundreds of these guys over the years in both Canada and the US Northeast while visiting various Salmon runs, especially the remote one's.  

Now, here's the onion.  When I learned that a portion of Pennsylvania had received 5 inches of rain in just 90 minutes, that's when it became clear to me.  You see, back in the 1940, they started messing around with cloud seeding, which involved dropping certain substances into the clouds to get them to buildup moisture and eventually precipitate.  But, they couldn't get it to work and most certainly couldn't get it to drop the rain where the wanted to.  So, the project was largely abandoned.  But, a few kept at it.  

Start after covid, reports began to surface in the news media about how Western States have developed ""cloud seeing"" programs that involve the dispersion of Silver Iodide in the clouds in the hopes they could make it rain and assuage their water shortage issues.  What they're really doing is creating severe weather in the Midwest and the East, such as the 5 inches of rain in just 90 minutes that has claimed several lives, including two babies.  

Then, if that's not bad enough, the news media has the unmitigated gall to actually claim that climate change is causing these fires and the storms.   

Its all man made and our government is behind it to convince you that climate change is real threat.

Joel 2:10-11
10 The earth shall quake before them; the heavens shall tremble: the sun and the moon shall be dark, and the stars shall withdraw their shining:
11 And the LORD shall utter his voice before his army: for his camp is very great: for he is strong that executeth his word: for the day of the LORD is great and very terrible; and who can abide it?
Joel 2:28,30-31
28 And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions:
30 And I will shew wonders in the heavens and in the earth, blood, and fire, and pillars of smoke.
31 The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and terrible day of the Lord come.
Acts 2:19
19 And I will shew wonders in heaven above, and signs in the earth beneath; blood, and fire, and vapour of smoke:
1 Timothy 4:1-5
Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils; Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron; Forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats, which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth. For every creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving: For it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer.
2 Timothy 3:1-5, 12-13
1 This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.
2 For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,
3 Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good,
4 Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God;
5 Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.
12 Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution. 
13 But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving, and being deceived. Mark 13:32
But of that day and that hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels which are in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father.
Matthew 16:3
“And in the morning, It will be foul weather to day: for the sky is red and lowring. O ye hypocrites, ye can discern the face of the sky; but can ye not discern the signs of the times?” 
Jeremiah 50:38
A drought is upon her waters; and they shall be dried up: for it is the land of graven images, and they are mad upon their idols.
Luke 21:8-18
8 And he said, Take heed that ye be not deceived: for many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and the time draweth near: go ye not therefore after them.
9 But when ye shall hear of wars and commotions, be not terrified: for these things must first come to pass; but the end is not by and by.
10 Then said he unto them, Nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom:
11 And great earthquakes shall be in divers places, and famines, and pestilences; and fearful sights and great signs shall there be from heaven.
12 But before all these, they shall lay their hands on you, and persecute you, delivering you up to the synagogues, and into prisons, being brought before kings and rulers for my name's sake.
13 And it shall turn to you for a testimony.
14 Settle it therefore in your hearts, not to meditate before what ye shall answer:
15 For I will give you a mouth and wisdom, which all your adversaries shall not be able to gainsay nor resist.
16 And ye shall be betrayed both by parents, and brethren, and kinsfolks, and friends; and some of you shall they cause to be put to death.
17 And ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake.
18 But there shall not an hair of your head perish.
Luke 21:25-28
25 And there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars; and upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity; the sea and the waves roaring;
26 Men's hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth: for the powers of heaven shall be shaken.
27 And then shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.
28 And when these things begin to come to pass, then look up, and lift up your heads; for your redemption draweth nigh. Luke 21:36
Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man. 
1 Peter 3:9-10
9 The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance. 
10 But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up.
Isaiah 28:2
“Behold, the Lord hath a mighty and strong one, which as a tempest of hail and a destroying storm, as a flood of mighty waters overflowing, shall cast down to the earth with the hand.” 
Isaiah 50:2
“Wherefore, when I came, was there no man? when I called, was there none to answer? Is my hand shortened at all, that it cannot redeem? or have I no power to deliver? behold, at my rebuke I dry up the sea, I make the rivers a wilderness: their fish stinketh, because there is no water, and dieth for thirst.” 
Revelation 16:11-12
 11 And blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores, and repented not of their deeds. 
 “And the sixth angel poured out his vial upon the great river Euphrates; 
12 and the water thereof was dried up, that the way of the kings of the east might be prepared.”
13 And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet.
14 For they are the spirits of devils, working miracles, which go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty.
15 Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed is he that watcheth, and keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked, and they see his shame.
16 And he gathered them together into a place called in the Hebrew tongue Armageddon.
Revelation 16:21
“And there fell upon men a great hail out of heaven, every stone about the weight of a talent: and men blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail; for the plague thereof was exceeding great.” 

‭‭2 Peter 3:3-4
3 Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts,
4 And saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation.
1 John 2:18
 Little children, it is the last time: and as ye have heard that antichrist shall come, even now are there many antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last time.
Amos 8:11  
Behold, the days come, saith the Lord GOD, that I will send a famine in the land, not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but of hearing the words of the LORD:
Luke 12:33 
Sell that ye have, and give alms; provide yourselves bags which wax not old, a treasure in the heavens that faileth not, where no thief approacheth, neither moth corrupteth.
Luke 21:11 
 And great earthquakes shall be in divers places, and famines, and pestilences; and fearful sights and great signs shall there be from heaven.

@SendU2Jesus,"Wish everyone safety through this. This has increased rapidly in just a few years. Imagine what world our children's children will inherit. We cannot wait any longer, governments have to act toward climate change now. CO2 is heavier and sits in the atmosphere for a long time. This means that it collects in our atmosphere and make it harder for reflective rays from our planet to escape back into space. It creates a ""greenhouse effect,"" as we warm up only inside of the hot windowed bubble, while everything else outside remains cooler. As we increase vehicle usage/emissions, population, and the burning of coal and fossil fuels for energy, events like this will get much worse and more frequent. It will quickly, overnight, no longer be ""someone else's problem."" The three major contributors toward CO2 emissions and fossil fuel burning are America, China, Russia. The world has to work together. Lead by example. Electric vehicles, and all solar/wind/alternative energy sources will resolve our problem. Not immediately.

@steppingonlego7493,"As a Canadian living in western Canada. It's to be expected as decades of fire suppression and poor forest management practices have led to unhealthy forests. Fires have always naturally cleared out old and diseased trees and underbrush. In western Canada we saw a epidemic of pine/spruce beetle devastate our forests because of government allocation of provincial parks like Tweedsmiur Park that were off limits from any intervention apart from fire suppression. When the pest infestation took hold it spread quickly. That gave the green light for government to uplift the annual allowable cut to forestry companies who took full advantage clear cutting massive areas of timber and replacing it with monocultures of marketable timber (conifers) that are more susceptible to fire. Further to that, aerial spraying herbicides like glyphosate to eliminate any biodiversity. This has led to erosion issues and created a perfect storm of raising fire risk. It was and has been decades of forest mismanagement that created this situation and now the current government clings to buzz words like climate change which is an alibi for decades of governments shortsighted bad decisions.",2023-07-18T13:40:23Z,17,6.0,as a canadian living in western canada it s to be expected as decades of fire suppression and poor forest management practices have led to unhealthy forests fires have always naturally cleared out old and diseased trees and underbrush in western canada we saw a epidemic of pine spruce beetle devastate our forests because of government allocation of provincial parks like tweedsmiur park that were off limits from any intervention apart from fire suppression when the pest infestation took hold it spread quickly that gave the green light for government to uplift the annual allowable cut to forestry companies who took full advantage clear cutting massive areas of timber and replacing it with monocultures of marketable timber conifers that are more susceptible to fire further to that aerial spraying herbicides like glyphosate to eliminate any biodiversity this has led to erosion issues and created a perfect storm of raising fire risk it was and has been decades of forest mismanagement that created this situation and now the current government clings to buzz words like climate change which is an alibi for decades of governments shortsighted bad decisions

@draganaspasevska,"I just watched a video about how native Americans in Montana for years did controlled burns. It’s a key tool to prevent huge fires like this. However, they said they’ve only been able to do 1 controlled burn this year because the climate conditions (right temperature and humidity) need to be at a sweet spot. So we are falling behind because the weather is hotter and drier, and we’re not able to use these preventative measures. Climate change is not the full picture I agree, but it IS impacting our ability to manage forests how we have historically done it.",2023-07-19T02:57:29Z,2,,i just watched a video about how native americans in montana for years did controlled burns it s a key tool to prevent huge fires like this however they said they ve only been able to do 1 controlled burn this year because the climate conditions right temperature and humidity need to be at a sweet spot so we are falling behind because the weather is hotter and drier and we re not able to use these preventative measures climate change is not the full picture i agree but it is impacting our ability to manage forests how we have historically done it

@steppingonlego7493,"@@draganaspasevska further to this discussion with regards to Montana. Montana's Glacier National Park resides on the continental divergence that is the head waters to 3 major tributaries that supply water to hundreds of millions of people. Much of that water is controlled through man made infrastructure such as dams, levees, canals and channels down stream. Those who have established themselves along the banks of these tributaries are reliant on those waters as it provides the necessary resources for drinking, agriculture, energy and commerce. As that water is used and displaced much of the land has been changed to accommodate. Wetlands and flood plains have been drained to build communities and support agricultural. Vast lands have been flooded to create dams for energy. It all has implications beyond the scope of today's uses. It changes weather and areas of daily evaporation. Concentration of water to support vegetation to accommodate human needs while depriving areas that were once fertile. A good analogy of this would be how similar vains and arteries in the human body work to support all parts of the body. So what happens if you block or change the course of these systems? Inevitably a part of that body will die. The Blackfeet and Flathead Indian tribes could never have fathomed how crucial their traditional territories would be to support the growth of hundreds of millions of people. What they did know is how to live in harmony with this system and how important and fragile it is. When we deprive areas of the life blood (water) eventually it will die, burn and be forgotten.",2023-07-19T14:04:08Z,0,,further to this discussion with regards to montana montana s glacier national park resides on the continental divergence that is the head waters to 3 major tributaries that supply water to hundreds of millions of people much of that water is controlled through man made infrastructure such as dams levees canals and channels down stream those who have established themselves along the banks of these tributaries are reliant on those waters as it provides the necessary resources for drinking agriculture energy and commerce as that water is used and displaced much of the land has been changed to accommodate wetlands and flood plains have been drained to build communities and support agricultural vast lands have been flooded to create dams for energy it all has implications beyond the scope of today s uses it changes weather and areas of daily evaporation concentration of water to support vegetation to accommodate human needs while depriving areas that were once fertile a good analogy of this would be how similar vains and arteries in the human body work to support all parts of the body so what happens if you block or change the course of these systems inevitably a part of that body will die the blackfeet and flathead indian tribes could never have fathomed how crucial their traditional territories would be to support the growth of hundreds of millions of people what they did know is how to live in harmony with this system and how important and fragile it is when we deprive areas of the life blood water eventually it will die burn and be forgotten

@traceyholt8223,"Here in Australia, we went through this just before Covid. We feel for Canada and know your pain.  AUSTRALIA: The first major bushfires began at the beginning of Sept. 2019. The fire situation worsened significantly at the beginning of November 2019 with increasing temperatures and a prolonged drought. In mid-February an extremely heavy rainstorm allowed firefighters to contain all of the fires in New South Wales (NSW), although fires continued to burn in Victoria. All of the fires were either extinguished or contained by March 4, 2020 – nine months after the first ones began to burn.The bushfires burned more than 46 million acres (72,000 square miles) – roughly the same area as the entire country of Syria. At least 80% of the Blue Mountains World Heritage area in NSW and 53% of the Gondwana world heritage rainforests in Queensland (QLD) were burned. More than a third of the koala population is thought to have been killed, while the loss of habitat will also significantly impact the species’ recovery. A study from Australia’s government found that 471 plants and 191 invertebrates were affected by the fires, with the most severely affected species losing at least 30% of their habitat. Smoke from the fires darkened the skies in New Zealand, and continued to circle the globe for more than three months.",2023-07-18T04:11:48Z,221,56.0,here in australia we went through this just before covid we feel for canada and know your pain australia the first major bushfires began at the beginning of sept 2019 the fire situation worsened significantly at the beginning of november 2019 with increasing temperatures and a prolonged drought in mid february an extremely heavy rainstorm allowed firefighters to contain all of the fires in new south wales nsw although fires continued to burn in victoria all of the fires were either extinguished or contained by march 4 2020 nine months after the first ones began to burn the bushfires burned more than 46 million acres 72 000 square miles roughly the same area as the entire country of syria at least 80 of the blue mountains world heritage area in nsw and 53 of the gondwana world heritage rainforests in queensland qld were burned more than a third of the koala population is thought to have been killed while the loss of habitat will also significantly impact the species recovery a study from australia s government found that 471 plants and 191 invertebrates were affected by the fires with the most severely affected species losing at least 30 of their habitat smoke from the fires darkened the skies in new zealand and continued to circle the globe for more than three months

@michellesheaff3779,"@salauerman7082 An extraordinarily early, hot, dry spring and lots of lightening storms. There have been more than 3000 wildfires across the country so far. These conditions are all a result of climate change, including more lightening strikes, and created the perfect storm for wildfires in the second largest forest in the world, truly wild wilderness. A small number of those fires may have been an illegal campfire (they've been prohibited for months), but even in normal years it's mostly lightening strikes. Here in Quebec I saw it happening in real time. We had been spared and were helping Nova Scotia which normally doesn't get any wildfires and Halifax, their capital city, was in grave danger. Then a massive storm swept across Quebec and thousands of lightening strikes started hundreds of wildfires. In one day we went from zero fires to everywhere is burning. It took us weeks to get them under control. But some of them in Abitibi (northwest Quebec) are still burning. When mother nature creates a conflagration of that size only mother nature can extinguish it. We need rain. All we can do is contain them and put out the smaller ones.

@Krusty-kl5ej,"@@michellesheaff3779 They generally cut off the historical graphs at 1983.   That year there was a low in overall fires.  Previous to 1983 there was a steady decline from pre- WW2 when there were over 10 times the areas burning today.  In natural circumstances, fire rejuvenates the forest canopy.    Upon the development of airborne fire fighting techniques, we artificially tempered those outbreaks, and with the reductions in forest harvesting, major areas were allowed to get too old.   These are prime large area burn potential because of overgrowth and higher propensity to crown and spread burn.

@daleviker5884,"What left wing activist Tracy Holt doesn't mention is that massive bushfires in Australia are just a routine part of recorded history. In the state of Victoria in 1851, an event known as ""Black Thursday"" occurred. The colony of Melbourne had only just begin to sprout, with a population of 23,000 compared with today's 5m. After several very hot summers (accurate records weren't always kept) fires were everywhere in the summer of 1850/51. On February 6, the temperature reached 117° in the shade (as recorded in the local newspaper at the time) with high winds, and the fires expanded everywhere. Evidence at the later royal commission estimated that nearly 1/4 of the entire state had been burned out. The official death toll was 12, but certainly it was much higher because many people lived in isolation with no knowledge of them in Melbourne. Statistically, this is much worse than anything that has happened in modern times. Bushfires are terrible, but what's even more terrible is the way they are gleefully exploited for propaganda by activists who want to brainwash people into thinking that everything that happens today is unprecedented.

@daleviker5884,"@@bathurstaus   Statistics can be made to prove anything. For example, your claim that since 2000 we've had three large fires. Obviously your mission is to push the climate change hysteria, which is why you don't mention that the terrible fires of 2009 for eg were sparked by fallen power lines. The brainwashed kids coming out of university today aren't old enough to remember, they just swallow contextless propaganda at face value. 2009 demonstrated why it is only natural for there to be more fires as the population grows, because there is more chance of arson, or inadvertent activity like 2009. 

Of course the biggest contributor to fires these days is the different land management practices forced on society by the greenies. Talk to any farmer or firefighter and you'll hear their dismay about greenies who stop controlled burning that has been practiced for tens of thousands of years. I'm sure they didn't teach you at university about the aboriginal elders who have called the green movement clueless when it comes to land management. Read any accounts from early settlers in the late 1700s and early 1800s (eg Matthew flinders journal) and they all recount how the skies around Melbourne were frequently smoke filled because the indigenous peoples did controlled burn offs of undergrowth, a practice that white settlers then followed until the modern era, until the greens started dictating policy.",2023-07-19T12:04:28Z,0,,statistics can be made to prove anything for example your claim that since 2000 we ve had three large fires obviously your mission is to push the climate change hysteria which is why you don t mention that the terrible fires of 2009 for eg were sparked by fallen power lines the brainwashed kids coming out of university today aren t old enough to remember they just swallow contextless propaganda at face value 2009 demonstrated why it is only natural for there to be more fires as the population grows because there is more chance of arson or inadvertent activity like 2009 of course the biggest contributor to fires these days is the different land management practices forced on society by the greenies talk to any farmer or firefighter and you ll hear their dismay about greenies who stop controlled burning that has been practiced for tens of thousands of years i m sure they didn t teach you at university about the aboriginal elders who have called the green movement clueless when it comes to land management read any accounts from early settlers in the late 1700s and early 1800s eg matthew flinders journal and they all recount how the skies around melbourne were frequently smoke filled because the indigenous peoples did controlled burn offs of undergrowth a practice that white settlers then followed until the modern era until the greens started dictating policy

The observations line up with enough precision that they can tell within less than a day that there has been a fire started by lightning.

@an.american,"All weather on Earth, from the surface of the planet out into space, begins with the Sun. Both space weather and terrestrial (Earth) weather—the weather we feel on our planet’s surface—are influenced by the small changes the Sun undergoes during its solar cycle. The solar cycle happens because of its pole flip! The north becomes south and south becomes north every 11 years or so.
The Sun’s high temperatures cause electrically-charged gases to constantly move around, generating areas of powerful magnetic forces or fields. This motion creates a lot of activity on the Sun’s surface, called solar activity.
The solar cycle is an approximately 11-year cycle experienced by our Sun. During this cycle, the Sun’s solar activity becomes more stormy and builds to a “maximum.” The magnetic fields flip, and the north pole becomes the south pole on the Sun. Then, the Sun’s solar activity settles back down to a “minimum.” And another solar cycle begins. 
More sunspots means more solar activity. The dark spots are cooler than the surrounding areas. Solar flares, CMEs, and other explosions tend to occur near sunspot groups when the Sun is more active.
Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) 
Massive clouds of particles that spread into space, CMEs are large pieces of magnetic energy that are hurled from the Sun at speeds up to several million mph. 
Other solar events include solar wind streams that come from the coronal holes on the Sun and solar energetic particles that are primarily released by CMEs.

The Sun affects both weather and technology here on Earth. We are now in Solar Cycle 25. Record-keeping of solar cycles began in 1755 with Solar Cycle 1. The sun is now entering an extended period of low activity. Such a scenario would mitigate climate change. Global climate change, including long-term periods of global cold, rainfall, drought, and other weather shifts are influenced by solar cycle activity. The solar maximum or peak is predicted to happen in July, 2025.
Times of depressed solar activity seem to correspond with times of global cold in history. Conversely, times of increased solar activity have corresponded with global warming. During the 12th and 13th centuries, the Sun was active, and the European climate was quite mild.
Scientists measure solar cycles by keeping track of the number of sunspots appearing on the Sun’s surface as well as noting the location. A new solar cycle is considered to have begun when the sunspots group at higher latitudes with the magnetic polarities of the leading spots opposite that of the previous cycle. 
The Sun is now in Solar Cycle 25, which is heating up more than experts predicted! Solar Cycle record-keeping began in 1755. The new Solar Cycle 25 began in December of 2019. This was based on detailed records of the number of sunspots and solar cycle activity, as the 13-month smoothed sunspot number fell to 1.8.
Solar Cycle 25 is predicted to continue until 2030, with peak sunspot activity expected in 2025, according to the NASA/NOAA panel of solar science experts. 
Over the years of observing the Sun, we’ve learned that the Sun goes through warming and cooling cycles of about 11 years—which affects weather here on Earth.
When one 11-year solar cycle transitions to another, it starts quietly with low solar activity (called a “solar minimum”). Then the Sun’s activity builds up to the cycle’s peak (called a “solar maximum”) when its magnetic field reverses. Finally, the Sun settles back down to a minimum before another cycle begins. 
Overall, history has shown us that quiet-to-average solar cycles with deep solar minimums mean a cooling pattern. In other words, temperatures become colder than they would have been otherwise. 
If this cooling phase on Earth, however, is offset by any warming caused by increasing greenhouse gases, it also raises the question of whether an eventual warming cycle *could* lead to more rapid warming on Earth than expected.",2023-07-18T00:45:46Z,0,0.0,all weather on earth from the surface of the planet out into space begins with the sun both space weather and terrestrial earth weather the weather we feel on our planet s surface are influenced by the small changes the sun undergoes during its solar cycle the solar cycle happens because of its pole flip the north becomes south and south becomes north every 11 years or so the sun s high temperatures cause electrically charged gases to constantly move around generating areas of powerful magnetic forces or fields this motion creates a lot of activity on the sun s surface called solar activity the solar cycle is an approximately 11 year cycle experienced by our sun during this cycle the sun s solar activity becomes more stormy and builds to a maximum the magnetic fields flip and the north pole becomes the south pole on the sun then the sun s solar activity settles back down to a minimum and another solar cycle begins more sunspots means more solar activity the dark spots are cooler than the surrounding areas solar flares cmes and other explosions tend to occur near sunspot groups when the sun is more active coronal mass ejections cmes massive clouds of particles that spread into space cmes are large pieces of magnetic energy that are hurled from the sun at speeds up to several million mph other solar events include solar wind streams that come from the coronal holes on the sun and solar energetic particles that are primarily released by cmes the sun affects both weather and technology here on earth we are now in solar cycle 25 record keeping of solar cycles began in 1755 with solar cycle 1 the sun is now entering an extended period of low activity such a scenario would mitigate climate change global climate change including long term periods of global cold rainfall drought and other weather shifts are influenced by solar cycle activity the solar maximum or peak is predicted to happen in july 2025 times of depressed solar activity seem to correspond with times of global cold in history conversely times of increased solar activity have corresponded with global warming during the 12th and 13th centuries the sun was active and the european climate was quite mild scientists measure solar cycles by keeping track of the number of sunspots appearing on the sun s surface as well as noting the location a new solar cycle is considered to have begun when the sunspots group at higher latitudes with the magnetic polarities of the leading spots opposite that of the previous cycle the sun is now in solar cycle 25 which is heating up more than experts predicted solar cycle record keeping began in 1755 the new solar cycle 25 began in december of 2019 this was based on detailed records of the number of sunspots and solar cycle activity as the 13 month smoothed sunspot number fell to 1 8 solar cycle 25 is predicted to continue until 2030 with peak sunspot activity expected in 2025 according to the nasa noaa panel of solar science experts over the years of observing the sun we ve learned that the sun goes through warming and cooling cycles of about 11 years which affects weather here on earth when one 11 year solar cycle transitions to another it starts quietly with low solar activity called a solar minimum then the sun s activity builds up to the cycle s peak called a solar maximum when its magnetic field reverses finally the sun settles back down to a minimum before another cycle begins overall history has shown us that quiet to average solar cycles with deep solar minimums mean a cooling pattern in other words temperatures become colder than they would have been otherwise if this cooling phase on earth however is offset by any warming caused by increasing greenhouse gases it also raises the question of whether an eventual warming cycle could lead to more rapid warming on earth than expected

@frederickcwinterburn1837,"@@JonMartinYXD I'd be with you on that one except that the fires started simultaneously (within minutes of each other by the smoke plumes). It's improbable for it to have been lightning since the fires would have been staggered by hours or even days after the initial lightning strikes (if indeed lightning covered such a vast area). The satellite 'evidence' makes it more likely to have been fire bombs planted previously (likely drones) and then set off together by radio once the conditions were right. The crux of it is whether the satellite imagery we have all seen is true. I tend to believe it is based on the sources. Regardless, arson has played a huge part in the Canadian forest fires this year. Plenty of arrests but very little mainstream media coverage.",2023-07-20T11:59:42Z,0,,i d be with you on that one except that the fires started simultaneously within minutes of each other by the smoke plumes it s improbable for it to have been lightning since the fires would have been staggered by hours or even days after the initial lightning strikes if indeed lightning covered such a vast area the satellite evidence makes it more likely to have been fire bombs planted previously likely drones and then set off together by radio once the conditions were right the crux of it is whether the satellite imagery we have all seen is true i tend to believe it is based on the sources regardless arson has played a huge part in the canadian forest fires this year plenty of arrests but very little mainstream media coverage
@JonMartinYXD,"@@frederickcwinterburn1837 It was literally a line of thunderstorms moving in parallel.  Like what happens when a front moves in?  So yes, there were dozens of lightning strikes happening across hundreds of kilometres every minute.

Arson - as in the deliberate starting of fires - has been no worse this year than any other year.  The vast, vast majority of human causes are carelessness: tossed cigarette butts (should be crime even if it doesn't start a fire), campfires, but most of all off-road vehicle use.  Off-roading is especially a problem in the late spring between the end of the melt and the start of the rains.  That is when the ground cover fuel - dead grass, fallen leaves, etc. - is tinder dry.  A vehicle with a hot exhaust driving through/over that is just asking for a fire.  That time of year is also when people are itching to get out and drive their quad or whatever after 4+ months of winter.  So early season fires are predominantly human caused, starting at ground level.  Then as the spring/summer progresses, rain, decomposition, and new growth make the ground cover less flammable.  But then the thunderstorms start.  Lightning does not need tinder dry ground cover to start a fire.  Lightning hits and starts fires in trees.  There are lots of videos showing what lightning can do to trees.

Has the number of human caused fires been higher this year?  Yes, because it was a very dry spring.  Has the number of lightning caused fires been higher this year?  Yes, because the forests - the trees collectively - are dry due to multiple years of below average rainfall, ie. drought.  There is no evidence of elaborate arson plots.  The explanation for the fire problem is simple: it is unusually hot and dry and it has been unusally hot and dry for multiple years.

Please stop spreading baseless conspiracy fantasies.  It distracts from finding practical things we can do to reduce fire risks.  For example, if the ground is dry due to a below normal amount of snow or an early melt, maybe we need to say no off-roading and no campfires until the rains come.",2023-07-20T13:02:51Z,0,,it was literally a line of thunderstorms moving in parallel like what happens when a front moves in so yes there were dozens of lightning strikes happening across hundreds of kilometres every minute arson as in the deliberate starting of fires has been no worse this year than any other year the vast vast majority of human causes are carelessness tossed cigarette butts should be crime even if it doesn t start a fire campfires but most of all off road vehicle use off roading is especially a problem in the late spring between the end of the melt and the start of the rains that is when the ground cover fuel dead grass fallen leaves etc is tinder dry a vehicle with a hot exhaust driving through over that is just asking for a fire that time of year is also when people are itching to get out and drive their quad or whatever after 4 months of winter so early season fires are predominantly human caused starting at ground level then as the spring summer progresses rain decomposition and new growth make the ground cover less flammable but then the thunderstorms start lightning does not need tinder dry ground cover to start a fire lightning hits and starts fires in trees there are lots of videos showing what lightning can do to trees has the number of human caused fires been higher this year yes because it was a very dry spring has the number of lightning caused fires been higher this year yes because the forests the trees collectively are dry due to multiple years of below average rainfall ie drought there is no evidence of elaborate arson plots the explanation for the fire problem is simple it is unusually hot and dry and it has been unusally hot and dry for multiple years please stop spreading baseless conspiracy fantasies it distracts from finding practical things we can do to reduce fire risks for example if the ground is dry due to a below normal amount of snow or an early melt maybe we need to say no off roading and no campfires until the rains come

@rickh3714,"​@@MrWeedWackyPerhaps  being a cynical atheist (?)you contribute even less with your additional comment ?

To what extent are these 'plantations'?   Maybe some innappropriately & naively planted to appease carbon guilt travellers and fossil fuel hungry  industrialists? 

 Or ARE they all indigenous tracts  of forest where they should always have  belonged? 

For example in New Zealand we have had terrible issues recently  with exotic pines (often planted in entirely inappropriate places). 

These, &  abysmal forestry management led to large amounts of forestry slash c-logging rivers and beaches in our recent climate change likely Cyclones & Weather bombs. 

Our much smaller pine forests also turn into infernos at times with  6 or more helicopters needed with monsoon buckets. However I have seen nothing like this (with the possible exception of the Australian fires that sent enough smoke over the Tasman Sea to block out the Sun in large parts of NZ for a while). 

Is there adequate harvesting? Fire breaks? Enough crackdowns/ imprisonment of arsonists etc in Canada? 

Or is this more the result of very  slack forest  fire  management by forestry owners &/ or the state?

@stevenwendellnelson8861,"I am delivering a sermon to you 🙏 please read

Consistently Pray for forgiveness, guidance in a good (positive) direction, and for help against evil. Pray to be saved from hell  (whatever that may be). Pray for your friends and your family too, it only takes a minute or so/less at a time to pray. Do it and your life will slowly get better, or maybe quickly. It probably just depends on you and the kind of person you are/have been. Don't wait until its too late and you have to suffer the consequences of built up bad karma from immoral acts/unrepented sins. Maybe together we can help make the world a better place by changing ourselves for the better, and changing things around us for the better.
And addressing/thanking the CREATOR OF THE UNIVERSE, LORD GOD at the beginning and end of your prayers would be a good idea.
Be my friend and I will pray for you, but I do not know how much help me doing so will give you. You should try to practice daily prayer yourself.
I'm trying to help you get right with the LORD 🙏

Amen.

I have worded a short prayer for you to say if you are not sure what words to use, it may not be the best but here it is 😊

''   CREATOR OF THE UNIVERSE, LORD GOD,
Please forgive me and my friends and my family for our immoral acts, please help guide us in a positive direction and please help us against evil. Please save us from Hell and have mercy on our souls. Thank you for everything CREATOR OF THE UNIVERSE, LORD GOD. Amen.  ''

Please say this at least once a day for at least a month, do it longer if you want to and can 🙏

You should prostrate yourself if you don't want to do spoken prayer, or do both 🙏😊 Please worship the LORD GOD and not any idol. 

Please put your hands together 🙏 bow your head and say this prayer:
""CREATOR OF THE UNIVERSE, LORD GOD, please know that I worship you and not any idols. Thank you for everything CREATOR OF THE UNIVERSE, LORD GOD. Amen""

Say '  Om Namah Shivaya  ' or '  Om Namo Bhagavate Rudraya  ' out loud or in your head 108 times, or try to do it 1008 times 😊 try to do it everyday if you want

repeat this aloud for as long as you want to, try to do it for like an hour a day or say it in a prayer  ""Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me, a sinner""

You can also say this prayer once a day or repeat it aloud as many times as you would like to:
""Hail Mary, full of grace. The Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou amongst women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death, Amen.""

Thessalonians 5:16-18
""Rejoice always, pray without ceasing, give thanks in all circumstances; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you.""

Philippians 4:6-7
""Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.""

""O Blood and Water, which gushed forth from the Heart of Jesus as a fount of mercy for us, I trust in You!""   Repeat this aloud at least 3 times or as many as you want, do it everyday if you can

I apologize for all the words 😊 I know how it may look

@Marijuanifornia,"@@brycecupp9660 No magic necessary. Just the 14-minute 1942 US Department of Agriculture video, *Hemp for Victory.*
In the video, it even states that hemp can be used to make firehoses. Hemp grows quickly just about anywhere and takes in CO2 as it is growing. Hemp can make four times more paper per acre than trees. Hemp is the best crop for making Diesel fuel. Ford even made a plastic car body with hemp in 1941. There is video of it on YouTube. All of this is why the oil and logging industries lobbied Congress to outlaw Cannabis Sativa as ""Marijuana"" in 1937. But the license to grow Cannabis that is shown in *Hemp for Victory* reads, ""Producer of Marihuana.""

By ending US Federal Cannabis prohibition, industrial hemp will reduce pollution, replace fossil fuels, end deforestation and reverse climate change.
The US spends billions of dollars to keep Cannabis illegal and wage the ""war on drugs,"" and then imports hundreds of millions of dollars of hemp fiber from Canada and China. This hypocrisy needs to end.

of, just saying.  Alaska has very harsh laws for anyone who commits arson or let a fire get out of control.  And they get down to the last nitch of how any fire started no matter how far in the bush it is or how big either.  The penalties for a camper even that let a camp fire get out if control are thousands of dollars, jail time.  It is severe.  Never have I heard it was climate change that started any fire in Alaska.  Trudeau is going to use that as a excuse so no one will know which fires were man made and which ones were caused by lightening or natural causes etc.  Oh yeah, He is a never let a disaster go to waste person.

@JonMartinYXD,"@@GotMoxy The biggest fire in Canada right now is so big that all the waterbombers in the world could not contain it.  There are at least a dozen more fires in that size class across the country.  For every one of those, there are hundreds of smaller fires.  Alberta has had 870 fires so far this year, 117 still burning.  A lot of the aerial firefighting resources are directed at knocking out those small fires while they are still small enough to be put out.  The big ones?  The only thing that can slow them down is sustained cool rainy weather.

We know which fires are caused by lightning because there are satellites that record lightning strikes and satellites that detect hot spots.  The observations line up with enough precision that they can tell within less than a day that there has been a fire started by lightning.  That is one of the ways they know how to direct aerial firefighting resources.  Without satellites we would be totally screwed because we wouldn't know about many of these lightning started fires until a human spotted them and that would be too late.  As it is, it is so dry and hot that some fires are beyond control within _hours_ of ignition.

Why is it so dry and hot?  Climate change.  You can pretend it isn't true, but the evidence is undeniable: the climate is changing, and it is changing faster than it has since the end of the Cretaceous period about 66 million years ago.",2023-07-20T00:41:29Z,1,,the biggest fire in canada right now is so big that all the waterbombers in the world could not contain it there are at least a dozen more fires in that size class across the country for every one of those there are hundreds of smaller fires alberta has had 870 fires so far this year 117 still burning a lot of the aerial firefighting resources are directed at knocking out those small fires while they are still small enough to be put out the big ones the only thing that can slow them down is sustained cool rainy weather we know which fires are caused by lightning because there are satellites that record lightning strikes and satellites that detect hot spots the observations line up with enough precision that they can tell within less than a day that there has been a fire started by lightning that is one of the ways they know how to direct aerial firefighting resources without satellites we would be totally screwed because we wouldn t know about many of these lightning started fires until a human spotted them and that would be too late as it is it is so dry and hot that some fires are beyond control within hours of ignition why is it so dry and hot climate change you can pretend it isn t true but the evidence is undeniable the climate is changing and it is changing faster than it has since the end of the cretaceous period about 66 million years ago

The fires happen every year since the end of the last Ice Age. The summer thunderstorms roll across the northern forest. Alaska to Newfoundland and Quebec (5000 miles by 1000 miles. They form up in the afternoon and scatter across the land. The storms let loose in the early evening.  The lightning strikes set the fires.  Small spot fires that smolder for a few hours and then flare up. 
This as a few years ago is a bad fire season because the forest has been in a drought  condition for 10+ years.  Before then they would burn out on their own. They were left to burn out the deadwood and a flush of new growth in spring. Food for wildlife. They were only fought when around the few small communities. They keep the bush cleared close to towns. 
It is by coincidence that the jet stream flow has dipped down the US eastern coast pulling the smoke into the US.

@ecurewitz,"@@chrissmith3509 sure about that? Because this is what the EPA has to say about it Together, forests, shrubland, and grassland cover more than half of the land area in the United States.1 These ecosystems are important resources, both environmentally and economically. Although wildfires occur naturally and play a long-term role in the health of these ecosystems, changing wildfire patterns threaten to upset the status quo. Multiple studies have found that climate change has already led to an increase in wildfire season length, wildfire frequency, and burned area.2,3 The wildfire season has lengthened in many areas due to factors including warmer springs, longer summer dry seasons, and drier soils and vegetation.4 Similarly, climate change threatens to increase the frequency, extent, and severity of fires through increased temperatures and drought (see the U.S. and Global Temperature and Drought indicators).5 Earlier spring melting and reduced snowpack (see the Snowpack indicator) result in decreased water availability during hot summer conditions, which in turn contributes to an increased wildfire risk, allowing fires to start more easily and burn hotter. These trends of longer wildfire seasons and larger wildfire size are predicted to continue as more frequent and longer droughts occur.6 In addition to climate change, other factors—land use, large-scale insect infestation, fuel availability (including invasive species such as highly flammable cheatgrass), and management practices, including fire suppression—play an important role in wildfire frequency and intensity. All of these factors influencing wildfires vary greatly by region and over time, as do precipitation, wind, temperature, vegetation types, and landscape conditions. Therefore, understanding changes in fire characteristics requires long-term records, a regional perspective, and consideration of many factors.

But wait there’s more from the university of Maryland 
New data on forest fires confirms what we’ve long feared: Forest fires are becoming more widespread, burning nearly twice as much tree cover today as they did 20 years ago.

Using data from a new study by researchers at the University of Maryland, we calculated that forest fires now result in 3 million more hectares of tree cover loss per year compared to 2001 — an area roughly the size of Belgium — and accounted for more than a quarter of all tree cover loss over the past 20 years.
In fact, 2021 was one of the worst years for forest fires since the turn of the century, causing an alarming 9.3 million hectares of tree cover loss globally — over a third of all tree cover loss that occurred that year.",2023-07-19T10:10:52Z,3,,sure about that because this is what the epa has to say about it together forests shrubland and grassland cover more than half of the land area in the united states 1 these ecosystems are important resources both environmentally and economically although wildfires occur naturally and play a long term role in the health of these ecosystems changing wildfire patterns threaten to upset the status quo multiple studies have found that climate change has already led to an increase in wildfire season length wildfire frequency and burned area 2 3 the wildfire season has lengthened in many areas due to factors including warmer springs longer summer dry seasons and drier soils and vegetation 4 similarly climate change threatens to increase the frequency extent and severity of fires through increased temperatures and drought see the u s and global temperature and drought indicators 5 earlier spring melting and reduced snowpack see the snowpack indicator result in decreased water availability during hot summer conditions which in turn contributes to an increased wildfire risk allowing fires to start more easily and burn hotter these trends of longer wildfire seasons and larger wildfire size are predicted to continue as more frequent and longer droughts occur 6 in addition to climate change other factors land use large scale insect infestation fuel availability including invasive species such as highly flammable cheatgrass and management practices including fire suppression play an important role in wildfire frequency and intensity all of these factors influencing wildfires vary greatly by region and over time as do precipitation wind temperature vegetation types and landscape conditions therefore understanding changes in fire characteristics requires long term records a regional perspective and consideration of many factors but wait there s more from the university of maryland new data on forest fires confirms what we ve long feared forest fires are becoming more widespread burning nearly twice as much tree cover today as they did 20 years ago using data from a new study by researchers at the university of maryland we calculated that forest fires now result in 3 million more hectares of tree cover loss per year compared to 2001 an area roughly the size of belgium and accounted for more than a quarter of all tree cover loss over the past 20 years in fact 2021 was one of the worst years for forest fires since the turn of the century causing an alarming 9 3 million hectares of tree cover loss globally over a third of all tree cover loss that occurred that year

Now forest paths has stacks of firewood on both sides just from clearing the fallen trees off of the path.

@Sharon-bo2se,"@happyevelyn  do you have any idea just how big and wild my country is??? Most of us live within 200 km or less of the border so roads, towns, access, etc., are not so common away from urban areas. Add in mountainous terrain as in British Columbia so good luck. Fire has always been a natural occurrence but the combination of droughts out in the western areas has worsened it. Think of California and its raging fires, especially when the Santa Ana winds blow. 
Most fires are naturally caused, about 80% where I live. We do get human caused fires, generally by careless actions, and we do try to track those down. Fire bans have been in place for some time now. As it worsens, our woods are closed down to limit access in vulnerable areas. 

Your statement reminds me of Trump when he talked about raking the forest floor. The forests on the West Coast are very dense, unlike the Eastern woodlands. The First Nations peoples, as well as the colonizers, have always used the waterways for travel for this reason. Add this to the vertical real estate and limited water and good luck. We have had a lot of practice fighting fires but when they grow so fast, sometimes all we can do is evacuate and do our best. Our BC wildfire service began in 1912. So far this year, BC has had over 1,042 fires, covering over 1.2 million hectares(100 hectares = 1 sq km) approx 5,000 sq miles. 

Generally, the smoke goes more easterly than south-east but the jet stream currently has shifted to sweep down into the mid-west and beyond. I would suspect that is partly why the heat dome is causing so much distress in the south-west. I do appreciate the discomfort of heavy smoke, have experienced it more than once and expect it to cover my area soon as the fires move closer.

@JonMartinYXD,"@@lapidaryland  Apologies for my delayed reply.

Let's assume that the rail/road network can get the first responding firefighters to their drop off point instantaneously.  A fit, unencumbered person can walk about 6 km/h on an unsloped sidewalk.  A _very_ fit person can sustain that for 8 hours in a 24 hour period, so ~50 km.  Our very fit firefighters however will be traversing a trackless forest while carrying a lot of gear, so we have to cut that in half: they can travel 25 km from their drop off point in a day.  That means the maximum size each 'cell' of forest can be is 50 x 50 km.  The 1000 x 1000 km forest has to be split into 400 50 x 50 km cells with 19 north-south cuts and 19 east-west cuts (we will assume that there is a road/railway all around the periphery of the forest - 25 km of access into the forest on all sides without a cut).

First of all, we have already destroyed the forest.  In Canada the minimum clearance width for a railway is 10.972 m.  That is wide enough that some animals, eg. woodland caribou, _will not cross_ even if there wasn't a man-made structure there.  Those animal populations have now been locked up in 400 boxes, unable to interbreed which will lead to genetic drift and the decline of the entire population.

The length of new railway to be built just in that forest is 38,000 km.  Right now Canada has 49,422 km of rail lines, the fifth longest in the world.  That additional 38,000 km on its own would be seventh in the world.  Low ball construction cost estimate of $1 million per km for a total of $38 billion.  That would buy over 1000 waterbombers.",2023-08-17T09:00:50Z,0,,apologies for my delayed reply let s assume that the rail road network can get the first responding firefighters to their drop off point instantaneously a fit unencumbered person can walk about 6 km h on an unsloped sidewalk a very fit person can sustain that for 8 hours in a 24 hour period so 50 km our very fit firefighters however will be traversing a trackless forest while carrying a lot of gear so we have to cut that in half they can travel 25 km from their drop off point in a day that means the maximum size each cell of forest can be is 50 x 50 km the 1000 x 1000 km forest has to be split into 400 50 x 50 km cells with 19 north south cuts and 19 east west cuts we will assume that there is a road railway all around the periphery of the forest 25 km of access into the forest on all sides without a cut first of all we have already destroyed the forest in canada the minimum clearance width for a railway is 10 972 m that is wide enough that some animals eg woodland caribou will not cross even if there wasn t a man made structure there those animal populations have now been locked up in 400 boxes unable to interbreed which will lead to genetic drift and the decline of the entire population the length of new railway to be built just in that forest is 38 000 km right now canada has 49 422 km of rail lines the fifth longest in the world that additional 38 000 km on its own would be seventh in the world low ball construction cost estimate of 1 million per km for a total of 38 billion that would buy over 1000 waterbombers
