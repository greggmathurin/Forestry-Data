# Forestry-Data

The forestry sector within Alberta specifically is considered a major pillar
for the community providing for approximately over 2,000,000 jobs in 2020.
Having lived in the province for more than 10 years, it is evident that many
individuals appreciate the nature around us from their different outdoor
hobbies (i.e. Hiking, Camping, etc..). Personally, I use it as a source of
mental health relief to decompress away from the hectic lifestyle that living
in a city can bring. Through this article, I aim to highlight certain interesting
characteristics of the forest industry while guiding strategies for sustainable
forestry practices in Canada. This data analysis will involve the intricate
dynamics of Canadaâ€™s forestry sector, identifying certain trends and
shedding light on the challenges and opportunities facing this vital industry.
